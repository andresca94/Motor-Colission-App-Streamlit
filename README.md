# Motor-Colission-App-Streamlit

I loaded and cleaned the Motor Collision in New York City dataset. Creation of a 3D map and data visualization to respond the questions “Where are the most people injured in NYC?” and “How many collisions occur during a given time of day”. Breakdown by minute and affected type Pedrestrians, Cyclist, Motorist. Front end using Streamlit.
